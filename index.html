			<p class="intro">Currently, I am in my last semester of college studying for an associateâ€™s degree in Computer Information Systems. I enjoy programming as a hobby and primarily focus on game development.</p>

					<button>Upgraded Hoppers</button>

				<p>A Minecraft mod I developed when I first started learning Java. I had to simultaneously learn Java and how to create a Minecraft mod to complete this project.</p>

					<button>Whack-A-Cirno</button>
				</a>
				<p>Created as a school project, this is a web-based Whack-A-Mole game. My primary goal here was to make something more animated than a still image of a mole popping out and going back into its hole.</p>

					<button>Fishing Sharks</button>
				</a>
				<p>This game was developed in Java as a class project during my first Java class. I particularly enjoyed this project as it shared similarities to a game I enjoyed before Chrome dropped support for Flash games.</p>
