			<p class="intro">Currently, I am in my last semester of college studying for an associateâ€™s degree in Computer Information Systems. I enjoy programming as a hobby and primarily focus on game development.</p>

			<div class="project">
				<button>Upgraded Hoppers</button>
				<p>A Minecraft mod I developed when I first started learning Java. I had to simultaneously learn Java and how to create a Minecraft mod to complete this project.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="project">
				<button>Whack-A-Cirno</button>
				<p>Created as a school project, this is a web-based Whack-A-Mole game. My primary goal here was to make something more animated than a still image of a mole popping out and going back into its hole.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="project">
				<button>Fishing Sharks</button>
				<p>This game was developed in Java as a class project during my first Java class. I particularly enjoyed this project as it shared similarities to a game I enjoyed before Chrome dropped support for Flash games.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="project">
				<button>Backdoors</button>
				<p>My first "big" project utilizes pre-built rooms, assets, and items to generate and fill every room randomly in real time as you travel between them.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="project">
				<button>Rii Menu</button>
				<p>My first Roblox creation is a recreation of the Nintendo Wii home Menu page. This recreation is designed to be a customizable alternative to the Roblox menu.</p>
